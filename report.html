    ****IMPORTANT**** For testing purposes go to the WOW armory by clicking on armory on the first load of the website
    and search for random characters.  Get the character you want and the realm and then test away.
    OR just use "Kelthuzad" <--- server "Xzz" <--- Character OR "illidan" <--- server "utterlycrazy" <--- Character.

    - Link to deployed website on GitHub: https://ryansnoobcentral.github.io/username_to_twitch_account/

    - Description:
        - So my app's main purpose at the moment is to:
            - Allow a user to search the blizzard World of Warcraft API through three regions "US/EU/KR"
              if given the character name and realm.
            - It will then display the current characters in-game model, have links to the characters armory,
              have the closest matching twitch channel (based off of the name of the character) displaying at the bottom,
              have a link to the actual twitch channel, and then a list of other possible twitch channels related to the
              characters name in the case that the "closest matching twitch channel" is not correct.
            - More features will be added later and hopefully the version you're viewing has a working leaderboards.

    - How my project satisfies the assignment's requirements:
        - Deploy site:
            - The site is deployed on GitHub.
        - Is responsive:
            - The site uses html created with bootstrap classes that have an associated responsive css file.  I also
              added some more css to help better with the responsiveness on all platforms.
        - Has a search:
            - My website has a search in the form of searching for a character from World of Warcraft.
        - Displays results:
            - My website displays the character model, embedded twitch stream of the closest matching twitch stream,
              and other possible twitch results.
        - Results are filterable:
            - There are two instances of results for my website:
                - One, is from the realm list where you need to choose your own realm.
                    - This list is searchable and filterable using the created search box for it.
                - Two, is the other possible twitch results are filterable in the form of clicking the one that an
                  individual wants to view.  This will populate the correct embedded twitch stream to play.
